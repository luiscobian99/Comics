                        <p> This summer has been very beneficial to my career and my own personal growth as to figuring ot what I want to do with my career. Although I learned that I don't want to be a journalist, I found that I loved learning more about comic books and spreading what I have leaned with others. I took three journalism classes this summer and for one of them I had to create a social media beat account where I focused on Social Issues in DC Comics and from there I was able to learn about how much I love that subject. So far I've written two articles: One is about Green Arrow and Drug abuse and the other is about Crazy Jane and her trauma from abuse. If you're interested you can give them a read <a href="https://medium.com/@luiscobianjr"> here.</a>I hope you enjoy!

                <P> I'll use this paragraph to type random things and just kind of experiment with this app. Hello. Bonjour. Last night my housemate and I watched the original <strong>Leperchaun</strong> movie with Jennifer Anniston. I expected it to be bad but it was actually so good! The script, the cinematograpgy, the titular character: Chefs kiss. Anyways if you need TV show reccomendations I have a few. You can watch <strong>Doom Patrol</strong> on <em>DCUniverse or HBO Max </em>. That's the show which was the inspiration for the original blogpost that I wrote. Another show is Harley Quinn which is also on DC Universe and HBO Max. Please let me know if you watch it and what you think. Thanks. 
                        </P>

                    <h2> My Comic Book Twitter Account</h2>
                        <p> For that same class I used Twitter to share my blogposts about comic books. I've always really liked twitter and this just gave me an excuse to use it more. <a href= "https://twitter.com/Luis_SIDC"> This Twitter account</a> has become a means for me to not only talk about social issues in comic books, but all comic books in general. I was able to talk to other members of the comic book community and bring up discourse, contriversial opinions, and our favorite things about comics. I'll include a quote here just to mess around with playing with block quotes:

                        <p>
                        Now with my final paragraph, I would like to reflect. This was actually kind of fun. I would like to keep up and maintain a website, even though it would be a lot of work. I am really enjoying posting my comic book content on Medium, but if I had a blog on a website that would be really cool. A great way to make myself seem professional. I really love comic books and all comic book content so this might be the move. Anyways, here is a fun Wonder Woman and Superman Meme. Thank you for visiting my site.</p>
